# My Sketch

## Project Explanation

**My Sketch** is a generative art application built with React and Canvas. Its main goal is to create visually interesting, randomized sketches using a combination of geometric grid layouts, color palettes, and typographic elements. The result is a unique piece of generative art every time the sketch runs.

## Features

- **Generative Art:** Randomized grid-based compositions using custom palettes and ASCII-like characters.
- **React Integration:** The sketch is rendered as a React component for easy embedding and extension.
- **Customizable Palettes:** Multiple color schemes for diverse visual output.
- **Responsive Canvas:** Adapts to landscape or portrait orientation.
- **Typography:** Uses the Fira Code font for a modern, code-inspired look.
